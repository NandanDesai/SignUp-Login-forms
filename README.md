# SignUp-Login-forms
A sample signup and login form using Angular 2. This project is like my "Hello World" in Angular 2.

Here, I have used concepts like dependency injection (for using Service), routing etc.

Things I have missed are: form validation.

### My notes

>We have 4 key players in an Angular 2 app:

>1. Components
>2. Directives
>3. Routers
>4. Services

>The _**Component**_ encapsulates the template, data and the behavior of the view.
>We donâ€™t need to access the DOM to change a the value of a tag. In angular, we do it by data binding.
>If we need to talk to the backend server to fetch the data and if this process is no where related to the Component, we do it by using _**Services**_.
>A _**Directive**_ is a class that allows us to extend or control DOM. We can create custom tags or attributes.
>_**Routers**_ help in directing users to different pages based on the option they choose on the main page.

## Symbols and Notations used in Angular 2
>\# - variable declaration

>() - event binding

>[] - property binding

>[()] - two-way property binding

>{{ }} - interpolation

>\* - structural directives
